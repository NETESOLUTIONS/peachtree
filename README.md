## Description
This app was created in response to GSA RFQ:4QTFHS150004. The intention of the app is to showcase NETE's ability to deliver quality solutions in a modern agile way. The name of the app is in reference to the sponsoring agency and was named thusly to show respect for a new and enlightened way of  government procurement solutions.

Private industry is moving at a blinding pace and all the while opening up visibility into what they do, which has led to an explosion in collaboration. This network of openess can be leveraged by the governemnt. Groups like 18f and openDataFDA, and with guidance from visionary federal executive leaders such as Dr. Kass-Hout, the public sector is quickly catching up.

Peachtree was made as a prototype but also has the extensibility to be a full fledged delivery and methodology platform that can be leveraged for future products. It was made with openness in mind and leverages the community that has pushed technology solutions forward. It uses all open source technologies and frameworks. From things created by big corporations (AngularJs) to visualization frameworks that started with one man's vision (D3.Js Mike Bostock). The stack is built completely in javascript utlizing NodeJs with Express for the server side langage, and Angular for the front. The pattern library is also an open source project maintained by Google called Angular Material which is Googles new material design language for Angular. An added benefit of using this framework is that it is very accessibility forward. Making use of Aria Tags and a high contrast color libary.

This app attempts to answer a simple user story:
    "What drugs have adverse events, how serious are they and who reports them."

Although simple the user story has complexity when analyzed and could easily grow along with API's development. It leads to more questions through data discovery.
    * Are certain adverse events events limited to select demographic groups?
    * Are AE's of a certain kind related to specific agent or do all generic counterparts experience similar adverse events?
    * Why are reporting rates for certain agents higher than others?
    
The possibilities are endless and so many questions can be asked, and hopefully answered in world where a community has the opportunity to colloborate.

Nete is proud to deliver this app to GSA and regardless of outcome is excited to be a part of changing field that has the ability to make a world of difference.
