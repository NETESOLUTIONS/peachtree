PEACHTREE
User Testing – Wednesday, June 24, 2015

The dashboard has changed significantly from when I viewed it this afternoon versus this evening. The following is a critique of the later version. Also, peachtree is not testing ready. The below is a scenario devised from what I am able to see. 
SCENARIO: A doctor or researcher is treating a new patient/case and needs a reference list of *all* available drugs. The list will accurately and efficiently show prescription options and their related side-effects so that a choice will be agreeable with patient. At peachtree, they can easily sort medications, see their common side effects, and compare it against patient records. 
Peachtree tasks:
	Unable to devise list. I am only able to click on ‘Drugs’ tab, which returns a list of drugs and no additional options. 
RESULTS: 
Landing Page
Top banner:	
1.	‘peachtree’ starts as white text, a hover turns it yellow and the pointer changes as if I can click it but nothing happens. Afterwards, it is colored dark grey until you click again.
2.	I like the brown and yellow/orange together for the dashboard and drugs button. 

Dashboard:
1.	After you click ‘Dashboard’, it disappears until you click again. 
2.	The flight info and email buttons are obvious although unfunctional in current state.
3.	The buttons and notifications are much too far apart. It takes a while to understand that they are together. 
4.	Consider wrapping the flight info. 
5.	The table has no reference as to what it means. The header ‘People’ is redundant given what I can see here. 
6.	‘peachtree’ is sitting there in space, lonely. It also has tip that pops up when you hover 	over it. The same goes for ‘People.’ Those are the only two places on the dashboard that happens. 
7.	The table headers and values are so unaligned as to look disjointed. 

Drugs tab
1.	‘List of Drugs’ is redundant from what I can see. The tip also appears here when you hover. 
2.	‘Magnevist’ appears at the top of the list for unknown reason, it does not have the highest side effect reports. 
3.	The list is long and comes to an abrupt end. 
4.	A back to top or search option may be helpful here.

At this time, unable to add tasks from what I am able to see. I tried not to make compounded results, that is, if the feature has remained the same as yesterday then I did not comment. 
SCENARIO: List of Drugs
	Tasks
	1. Click ‘Drugs’ tab on top banner. 
	Results (PASS)
	1. List is now alphabetical with numbers at the top, however, I think the ‘7 Select’ entries are a 	distraction and may want to move numbers to the end. 
	2. The values for after effects could use a comma. I think it would be easier to read and 	compare. 
	3. Is there a search function? 

SCENARIO: Item Detail Page i.e. Adverse effects for the selected drug
	Unavailable. 
SCENARIO: Visualization for summary counts for Drugs with Adverse Effects
	Unavailable. 
ADDITIONAL UI RESULTS:
Landing Page
Top banner:	
1.	The logo is a nice touch, it and ‘peachtree’ could be closer together. 
2.	The tab text has changed color during mouseover and click. It’s nice that it is different from peachtree - as it is now able to be interpreted as branded, especially with the logo. 

Dashboard:
1.	The mail and travel options have bene replaced with buttons which are currently inoperable.
2.	The graph is new and visualizes the list next to it. Would be nice if it changed when you sorted the list to right? 
3.	Unless the user is a subject expert, ‘AE’ may not be clear. 
4.	The values for after effects could use a comma. I think it would be easier to read and compare.
