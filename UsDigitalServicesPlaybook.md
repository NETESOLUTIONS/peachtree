#Digital Services Playbook Checklist
1. Play 1: Understand what people need
    * Checklist:
        - [x] Early in the project, spend time with current and prospective users of the service
        - [x] Use a range of qualitative and quantitative research methods to determine people’s goals, needs, and behaviors; be thoughtful about the time spent
        - [x] Test prototypes of solutions with real people, in the field if possible
        - [x] Document the findings about user goals, needs, behaviors, and preferences
        - [x] Share findings with the team and agency leadership
        - [x] Create a prioritized list of tasks the user is trying to accomplish, also known as "user stories"
        - [x] As the digital service is being built, regularly test it with potential users to ensure it meets people’s needs 
    * Key Questions:
        * Who are your primary users?
            * 
        * What user needs will this service address?
            * This web service, 'peachtree,' is a place for a user to easily and efficently sort through drugs and their                 corresponding after effects with a reported count/rate.  
        * Why does the user want or need this service?
            * Peachtree will be a good first stop during the prescription decision-making process, or to crosscheck any                  unintended consequences after an intial prescription. 
        * Which people will have the most difficulty with the service?
            * We follow user-centered design principals with the hope that all user actions will be intuitive. 
        * Which research methods were used?
            * A/B, Usabilty, User Experience, Expert, Build, and Speed Testing were all used to progress from strat to                   finish. 
        * What were the key findings?
            * 
        * How were the findings documented? Where can future team members access the documentation?
            * Key finding were documented with comprehensive write-ups, styored as User Testing by version number and stored                 in correspnding Github repo main page. 
        * How often are you testing with real people?
            * Daily. 
2. Play 2: Address the whole experience, from start to finish
    * Checklist:
        - [x] Understand the different points at which people will interact with the service – both online and in person
        - [x] Identify pain points in the current way users interact with the service, and prioritize these according to user needs
        - [ ] Design the digital parts of the service so that they are integrated with the offline touch points people use to interact with the service
        - [ ] Develop metrics that will measure how well the service is meeting user needs at each step of the service
    * Key Questions:
        * What are the different ways (both online and offline) that people currently accomplish the task the digital service is designed to help with?
            * There is no readily available perscription drug after effects database. One would have to consult a doctor or              expert on the drug. One could also get this information from medical journals for which you must pay a premium. 
        * Where are user pain points in the current way people accomplish the task?
            * Inefficiency. To find this data you either have to know your destination or wade through a lot of bloated                  information which is unessecasry for the above defined user of this service, eg, definitions, picture, etc. 
        * Where does this specific project fit into the larger way people currently obtain the service being offered?
            * Peachtree would help medical professions bypass websites with too much information. The list with related after             effects is easier to referece and sort. 
        * What metrics will best indicate how well the service is working for its users?
            * 
3. Play 3: Make it simple and intuitive
    * Checklist:

        - [ ] Use the design style guide consistently for related digital services
        - [ ] Give users clear information about where they are in each step of the process
        - [ ] Follow accessibility best practices to ensure all people can use the service
        - [ ] Provide users with a way to exit and return later to complete the process
        - [ ] Use language that is familiar to the user and easy to understand
        - [ ] Use language and design consistently throughout the service, including online and offline touch points 
    * Key Questions:
        * What primary tasks are the user trying to accomplish?
            * Access a list of drugs, an item detail page for selected drug, and a dynamic visual of summary                             counts/statistics. 
        * Is the language as plain and universal as possible?
            * 
        * Why does the user want or need this service?
            * The user wants this service so that he or she may efficiently access a drug database, see their documented                after effects, and then cross check with patient or project history and see if the drug is compatible. 
        * What languages is your service offered in?
            * 
        * How does the service’s design visually relate to other government services?
            *

        - [x] Run usability tests frequently to see how well the service works and identify improvements that should be made
        - [x] Ensure the individuals building the service communicate closely using techniques such as launch meetings, war rooms, daily standups, and team chat tools
        - [ ] Keep delivery teams small and focused; limit organizational layers that separate these teams from the business owners
        - [x] Release features and improvements multiple times each month
        - [x] Create a prioritized list of tasks the user is trying to accomplish, also known as "user stories"
        - [ ] Use a source code version control system
        - [x] Give the entire project team access to the issue tracker and version control system

        * Which version control system is being used?
            * Github. 
        * How are bugs tracked and tickets issued? What tool is used?
            * We use Github to task and track issues. The task/issue become formalized in github as soon a developer or                  product owner brings it to the task managers attention.   
        * How is the feature backlog managed? What tool is used?
            * We use Github to move issues from milestone/sprint to milestone/sprint or put it into the undated 'backlog'                milestone. The issues are stored there and are not forgotten. 
        * How often do you review and reprioritize the feature and bug backlog?
            * Depends on the work load or importance - from daily to weekly. 
        * How do you collect user feedback during development? How is that feedback used to improve the service?
            * 
        * At each stage of usability testing, which gaps were identified in addressing user needs?
            * Backend architecture, frontend human-centered design, visualization stubbles or successes, and user interface              and usability.

        - [ ] Contract includes a transition of services period and transition-out plan          
    * Key Questions:
        * What is the scope of the project? What are the key deliverables?
            * 
        * What are the milestones? How frequent are they?
            * In Github, our milestones line up with either sprints, delivery deadlines, or both. 
        * What are the performance metrics defined in the contract (e.g., response time, system uptime, time period to address priority issues)?
            *
